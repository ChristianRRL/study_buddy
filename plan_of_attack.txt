part 1. starting with math
math has four domains (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, data analysis)
each domain has relevant subject areas (28 total)
if I tackle one subject area a day this would take 28 days to review
given I only have a limited time after work I can review for about 30-90 minutes
assuming I may take a day off on weekdays and weekends I have five days a week
now this is about 5-6 weeks of effort (only for math)
there are days I may make up ground a bit, but assuming upper bound of 5-6 weeks
given start date 2020-06-10 this gives me a rough end date of 2020-07-22

part 2. continuing with vocabulary
math will be main focus at first, but then will make time for vocabulary
possibly may do some vocabulary in parallel with math, but it should not conflict with math review
there are 700+ gre vocabulary words that are "repeat offenders" to focus on
I can roughly learn about 5-7 words in 30 minute intervals (about five minutes per word)
assuming two 30 minute intervals a day I can learn up to 10-14 words a day
applying the same assumption as earlier, I have five days a week
due to time constraints it may not be possible to study this way (2020-09-01 hard cut-off)
starting *right now* I have twelve weeks to study vocabulary (not factoring math)
this is not feasible and vocabulary is not my priority at the moment
however, I can compromise a bit and review vocabulary lightly during math study phase
light vocabulary study means roughly six words on average per study day (30 minute sessions) for the first 5-6 weeks
heavy vocabulary study means roughly 12 words on average per study day (2x30 minutes sessions) for the latter 6 weeks
rough calculations this gets me to 540 words
this is 3/4 the 700+ "repeat" offenders list, however, this may be sufficient
already a decent amount of the words I should know or have some familiarity

summary
based on the above mentioned observations and calculations, I have 12 weeks
I should be ready to take the gre roughly by saturday 2020-08-29
this plan considers few rest/break days, but other setbacks may/will occur
setbacks are fine and I should be able to press forward or re-evaluate the timeline/effort if absolutely needed to be more realistic and achievable
although not stated explicitly, this plan allows for taking the exam twice
once after the heavy math + light vocabulary initial 5-6 weeks (2020-07-18 or 2020-07-24)
second time after full vocabulary dedicated 6 weeks (2020-08-28)
